Built a free EVP analysis app that uses real FFT signal processing to classify audio captures as Class A/B/C.

Not random numbers. Real spectral centroid, formant detection, harmonic-to-noise ratio, and adaptive noise floor calibration.

Evidence reports include scientific references.

### Tweet 2
Your phone has a magnetometer. EVP-MINI reads it directly for real EMF detection in microtesla.

It also runs DFT on your accelerometer to detect infrasound — specifically Tandy's 18.98Hz fear frequency.

Free. No download. Just open the link.

Free ghost hunting app that doesn't fake its readings:

- Real-time FFT audio analysis (8192-point, 48kHz)
- A/B/C EVP classification with formant detection
- Magnetometer EMF detection
- 18.98Hz infrasound alerts
- 7 camera filters (night vision, edge detect, thermal)
- Full evidence reports

Most ghost hunting apps use random number generators and call it "EMF detection."

EVP-MINI reads your phone's actual magnetometer, calibrates a noise floor from your real microphone input, and classifies audio anomalies using the same techniques as audio forensics.

Also it warns you about auditory pareidolia.

### Tweet 5
New update to EVP-MINI:

- Spirit Box FM sweep (87.5-108MHz simulation)
- Night vision, edge detection, false color, motion trails, full spectrum camera filters
- Session recording + reverse playback
- Evidence report export (text + JSON)

Free tier includes full EVP analysis. Pro is $4.99 for life.

### Post 1: For "Ghost Hunters" type groups

**Subject:** Free paranormal investigation app — uses your phone's real sensors (EMF, infrasound, audio analysis)

Hey everyone. I wanted to share a tool I built for investigators.

EVP-MINI is a paranormal investigation app that runs in your phone's browser. No download needed, no account, no ads. Works on both iPhone and Android.

I built it because I was frustrated with ghost hunting apps that use random number generators and call it "EMF detection." Every reading in EVP-MINI comes from your phone's actual hardware.

**What you get for free:**

- EVP Scan mode with real-time audio FFT analysis
- Automatic A/B/C classification of captures based on spectral centroid, harmonic-to-noise ratio, formant structure, and signal-to-noise ratio
- Live spectrogram visualization
- Magnetometer-based EMF readings (your phone's real magnetic field sensor, in microtesla)
- Accelerometer-based infrasound detection — flags Tandy's 18.98Hz fear frequency
- Barometric pressure monitoring
- Full evidence report with timestamps, confidence scores, and scientific references

**What Pro adds ($4.99 one-time, lifetime):**

- Spirit Box FM sweep simulation with adjustable speed and noise settings
- 7 camera filters: Night Vision, Edge Detection, False Color, Motion Detection, Motion Trails, Full Spectrum (with CLAHE enhancement)
- Session recording
- Reverse audio playback for EVP review
- Audio and report export

The evidence reports are detailed. You get a narrative summary, every EVP classification with the raw metrics behind it, a log of every sensor anomaly event, and a scientific context section citing Tandy (1998), Nees & Phillips (2015), Baruss (2001), Raudive (1971), and Persinger (1987).

I use it on my own investigations and have been iterating on it based on fieldwork. I'd love to hear what this group thinks. If there are features you wish your equipment had, let me know — I might be able to build them.

Try it here: https://evp-mini.pages.dev

Share your results! I'd love to see screenshots of your evidence reports.

### Post 2: For "Paranormal Investigation" type groups

**Subject:** Investigation tool that works on your phone — real EMF, EVP classification, night vision, evidence reports

I've been working on a browser-based investigation toolkit and wanted to share it with people who might actually use it in the field.

EVP-MINI gives you most of the core investigation tools in one app:

**Audio:** Real-time frequency analysis with an 8192-point FFT. The app calibrates to your environment, then detects audio anomalies that stand out from the noise floor. Captures are classified A, B, or C based on multiple metrics — harmonic-to-noise ratio, formant detection (the resonant peaks that characterize human speech), spectral centroid, and SNR. You see a live spectrogram and audio level meters during the scan.

**EMF:** Reads your phone's magnetometer directly. Displays field strength in microtesla. Calibrates a baseline and alerts on deviations.

**Infrasound:** Runs frequency analysis on your accelerometer data and flags low-frequency vibrations, including the 18.98Hz frequency linked to feelings of dread and visual disturbances (Tandy, 1998).

**Visual:** Seven camera processing modes — night vision, edge detection, false color (thermal-style), motion detection, motion trails, and full spectrum with CLAHE contrast enhancement. These are real image processing algorithms, not color overlays.

**Spirit Box:** FM sweep simulation cycling through the broadcast band. Adjustable sweep speed and noise parameters.

**Evidence Reports:** Every session produces a detailed, structured report. Overall score out of 100, narrative summary, EVP detections with raw data, sensor event log, and scientific references. Exportable as text.

The free version includes the full EVP Scan mode — audio analysis, classification, sensors, and evidence reports. Pro is $4.99 one-time for spirit box, visual filters, recording, reverse playback, and export.

No app store. Just open this link on your phone: https://evp-mini.pages.dev

If you try it on an investigation, I'd genuinely love to hear how it performs. What works, what doesn't, what's missing. This is a one-person project and real investigator feedback is the most valuable thing I can get.

## Product Hunt Launch Copy

### Tagline (60 chars max)
Ghost hunting toolkit with real signal processing

### Description
EVP-MINI turns your phone into a paranormal investigation suite using real sensor data and professional audio analysis techniques. It captures and classifies EVP audio using FFT spectral analysis, detects EMF anomalies via your phone's magnetometer, monitors for infrasound, and generates detailed evidence reports with scientific references. Free to start, Pro for $4.99 lifetime.

### Key Features
- **Real-time EVP classification** — 8192-point FFT with formant detection, harmonic-to-noise ratio, and adaptive noise floor calibration. Classifies captures as A/B/C with confidence scores and pareidolia warnings
- **Actual sensor data** — Reads your phone's magnetometer (EMF in microtesla), accelerometer (infrasound detection including Tandy's 18.98Hz fear frequency), and barometer. No fake readings
- **7 camera filters + evidence reports** — Night vision, edge detection, false color, motion trails, full spectrum with CLAHE. Every session generates a structured evidence report with scientific context and exportable data

### Maker Comment

Hey Product Hunt! I built EVP-MINI because every ghost hunting app I tried used random number generators disguised as "EMF detectors." I wanted to build something that uses real signal processing and real sensor data.

The free tier gives you the full EVP analysis engine — real-time FFT, A/B/C classification with formant detection and HNR, live spectrogram, sensor readings, and evidence reports with scientific references. I include citations to Tandy (1998), Nees & Phillips (2015), and Baruss (2001), plus explicit warnings about auditory pareidolia on low-confidence detections.

Pro ($4.99 one-time) adds Spirit Box, seven camera filters, recording, reverse playback, and export.

Whether you believe in the paranormal or not, I think there's value in a tool that shows you real data and lets you draw your own conclusions instead of generating fake readings for entertainment. The paranormal investigation community deserves better tools.

It's a PWA — works on iPhone and Android, no app store needed. Just open the link.

I'd love to hear your feedback, especially from anyone with signal processing or audio engineering backgrounds. The classification thresholds are based on standard EVP research methodology, but there's always room to improve.
