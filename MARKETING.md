Hey everyone — I built EVP-MINI, a web app that turns your phone into a paranormal investigation tool.

It uses your actual device sensors (magnetometer for EMF, accelerometer for infrasound, camera for visual analysis) and does real-time audio analysis to classify EVPs.

What it does:
- EVP Capture with A/B/C classification (based on spectral centroid, formant detection, harmonic-to-noise ratio)
- Spirit Box with FM sweep simulation
- 7 visual filters including night vision, thermal, edge detection, and motion trails
- EMF detection via your phone's magnetometer
- Infrasound detection (flags 18.98Hz — Tandy's fear frequency)
- Word detection that identifies words in audio anomalies
- Evidence reports with scientific references

Free to use (EVP Scan mode). Pro upgrade is $4.99 for everything.

Works on iPhone and Android — no app store needed, just open the link:

Would love feedback from real investigators. What features would you add?
