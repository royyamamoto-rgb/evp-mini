      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="privacy-subtitle">EVP-MINI &mdash; Paranormal Investigation PWA</p>
      <p class="privacy-updated">Last updated: February 9, 2026</p>
    </div>

    <!-- 1. Introduction -->
    <div class="privacy-section">
      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>EVP-MINI (&ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;our,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the app&rdquo;) is a progressive web application available at <a href="https://evp-mini.pages.dev">evp-mini.pages.dev</a> that provides paranormal investigation tools including EVP audio analysis, spirit box simulation, visual camera filters, and environmental sensor readings.</p>
      <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your data. By using EVP-MINI, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- 2. What Data We Collect -->
    <div class="privacy-section">
      <h2>2. What Data We Collect</h2>
      <p>EVP-MINI is designed with a privacy-first architecture. We minimize data collection to only what is necessary for the app to function.</p>

      <h3>Data We Do NOT Collect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> require user accounts, usernames, or passwords.</li>
        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> record, upload, or store your audio or video on any server. All audio and video processing happens entirely on your device.</li>
        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect location data, contacts, or any personal files from your device.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Data We Do Collect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Payment information (via Stripe):</strong> If you purchase EVP-MINI Pro ($4.99 one-time), payment processing is handled entirely by Stripe. We receive only your email address and a Stripe customer ID to verify your purchase. We never see, process, or store your credit card number, CVV, or full billing details.</li>
        <li><strong>License status:</strong> Your Pro license status is stored locally in your browser&rsquo;s localStorage. No account or server-side profile is created.</li>
        <li><strong>Cookies and advertising data:</strong> Google AdSense, which serves display ads on our landing page, may set cookies and collect anonymized data for ad personalization and performance measurement. See Section 6 for details.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- 3. Device Permissions -->
    <div class="privacy-section">
      <h2>3. Device Permissions</h2>
      <p>EVP-MINI requests access to certain device hardware to provide its investigation features. All sensor data is processed locally on your device and is <strong>never transmitted to any server</strong>.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Microphone:</strong> Used for real-time EVP audio analysis, spectrogram display, spirit box simulation, and audio recording. Audio data is processed entirely in your browser using the Web Audio API. Recordings are stored only in temporary browser memory and can be exported locally by you.</li>
        <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Used for visual scan modes including night vision, edge detection, false color thermal, motion detection, and full spectrum enhancement. Video frames are processed in real time on a local HTML5 canvas. No images or video are captured, uploaded, or stored on any server.</li>
        <li><strong>Magnetometer (compass/magnetic sensor):</strong> Used for EMF (electromagnetic field) readings. Data is read via the browser&rsquo;s Generic Sensor API or DeviceOrientation events and processed locally.</li>
        <li><strong>Accelerometer:</strong> Used for vibration detection and motion analysis. Data is read via the DeviceMotion API and processed locally.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You can revoke any of these permissions at any time through your browser or device settings. Revoking permissions may limit certain app features.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- 4. Payment Processing -->
    <div class="privacy-section">
      <h2>4. Payment Processing</h2>
      <p>EVP-MINI Pro is a one-time purchase of $4.99 processed through <strong>Stripe</strong>. When you make a purchase:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You are redirected to a Stripe-hosted checkout page. All payment information (credit card, billing address) is collected and processed exclusively by Stripe.</li>
        <li>After successful payment, Stripe sends us a confirmation containing your <strong>email address</strong> and a <strong>Stripe customer ID</strong>. We use these solely to verify your Pro license.</li>
        <li>We do not store, process, or have access to your full payment card details at any time.</li>
        <li>Stripe&rsquo;s processing of your data is governed by the <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stripe Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our Stripe integration runs via Cloudflare Functions (serverless), which processes the checkout session and returns a license key. No persistent database of customer records is maintained on our side beyond what Stripe holds.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- 5. Third-Party Services -->
    <div class="privacy-section">
      <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>

    </div>

    <!-- 6. Cookies and Tracking -->
    <div class="privacy-section">
      <h2>6. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
      <p>EVP-MINI itself does not set any first-party tracking cookies. However, third-party services embedded in the app may set cookies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Google AdSense cookies:</strong> Used for ad serving, frequency capping, and aggregated ad reporting. These may include cookies such as those from the <code>doubleclick.net</code> and <code>google.com</code> domains.</li>
        <li><strong>Stripe cookies:</strong> Set during the checkout process for fraud prevention and session management.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can manage or block cookies through your browser settings. Blocking third-party cookies may affect ad display but will not impact core app functionality.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- 7. Data Retention and Local Storage -->
    <div class="privacy-section">
      <h2>7. Data Retention and Local Storage</h2>
      <p>EVP-MINI stores the following data in your browser&rsquo;s <strong>localStorage</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pro license status:</strong> A flag and license key indicating whether you have purchased EVP-MINI Pro.</li>
        <li><strong>App preferences:</strong> Your selected scan mode and settings for a better user experience.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This data is stored entirely on your device and is never transmitted to our servers. You can clear this data at any time by clearing your browser&rsquo;s site data for evp-mini.pages.dev.</p>
      <p>Audio recordings created during investigation sessions exist only in temporary browser memory. They are not persisted unless you explicitly choose to export them to your device. We have no access to exported files.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- 8. Children's Privacy (COPPA) -->
    <div class="privacy-section">
      <h2>8. Children&rsquo;s Privacy</h2>
      <p>EVP-MINI is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. Since the app does not require account creation and does not collect personal data beyond what is described in this policy, minimal data is involved.</p>
      <p>If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information through a Pro purchase, please contact us and we will take steps to remove that information.</p>
      <p>In compliance with the Children&rsquo;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we recommend that children under 13 use this app only with parental supervision.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- 9. Your Rights -->
    <div class="privacy-section">
      <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the following rights regarding your data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Right to access:</strong> You can request information about what data we hold about you. Since we do not maintain user accounts or server-side data stores, the only data associated with you is your Stripe transaction record (held by Stripe) and your local browser storage (held on your device).</li>
        <li><strong>Right to deletion:</strong> You can delete your localStorage data at any time through your browser settings. For Stripe transaction records, you may contact Stripe directly or reach out to us for assistance.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to opt out of personalized advertising:</strong> You can manage your Google ad preferences at <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Ads Settings</a> or use browser-level cookie controls.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to withdraw consent:</strong> You can revoke device permissions (microphone, camera, sensors) at any time through your browser or operating system settings.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), California, or another jurisdiction with applicable data protection laws, you may have additional rights under GDPR, CCPA, or equivalent regulations. Contact us to exercise these rights.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- 10. Data Security -->
    <div class="privacy-section">
      <h2>10. Data Security</h2>
      <p>EVP-MINI is served exclusively over HTTPS, ensuring encrypted communication between your device and our hosting infrastructure. Because sensor data is processed locally and never transmitted, the primary security boundary is your own device.</p>
      <p>Payment processing is handled by Stripe, which is PCI DSS Level 1 certified, the highest level of security certification in the payments industry.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- 11. Contact Information -->
    <div class="privacy-section">
      <h2>11. Contact Information</h2>
